    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Describe the general process for execution addition, regardless of base.</h3>
    <p>To add two numbers, start with the right-most column and add those digits together. If the sum is more than the base of the number system, carry the leading 1 to the next column. Add the next column to the right and continue until you reach the left-most column.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h3>
    <p>When adding octal numbers, you will add the numbers normally except when you reach a number 8 or higher in any column. If you reach a number like this, you will divide it by 8. The remainder will the the number that stays in that column and the quotient will be carried over to the next digit.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h3>
    <p>When adding hexadecimal numbers, you will add the numbers normally except when you reach a number 16 or higher in any column. If you reach a number like this, you will divide it by 16. The remainder will the the number that stays in that column and the quotient will be carried over to the next digit. You also have to account for letters like 'a,b,c,d,e and f' which will be matched to '10,11,12,13,14, and 15'.</p>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h3>
    <p>The Binary system is very similar to the decimal system except you are working with a base of 2 instead of 10. As such, you carry the 1 to the nest digit when you reach the number 2 in any column because in the binary system, the only numbers you can use are 1 and 0.</p>
