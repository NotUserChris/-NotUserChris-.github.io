    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h4>Question 1:Why is one of the symbols for exclusive disjunction</h4>
    <p>'Xor' also known as exclusive disjunction means that the output is only true when exactly one of the inputs is true, not the same.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h4>Question 1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n?</h4>
    <p>Each input can only takr on two values, 0 or 1. The combination of inputs make a tree with the 1's and 0's that grows with each new input. With 1 input you have 2^1 combinations and with 2 inputs you have 2^2=4 combinations, etc.</p>
