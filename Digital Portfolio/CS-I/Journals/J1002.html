    <h1>CS-I Journal J1002: Shell</h1>
    <h2>Name: Christopher Brehm</h2>
    <h3>Date: 28-Aug-2022</h3>
<br>
    <p>I received assistance from: Andrew Brehm, Darrian Nguyen</p>
    <p>I assisted: Theo Yakovlev, Andrew Brehm</p>
<br>
    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h4>Question 1: What two directories do you use?</h4>
    <p>Two of the main services that I use are Discord and Snapchat.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h4>Question 2.1: Do you think that having two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why? </h4>
    <p> I think that the ability to have two different users can display two different files, making it more simple. This will also not overload the servers with information.</p>
<br>    
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h4>Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</h4>
    <p> The symbol will help you know that you are inside the root directory.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h4>Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is it useful?</h4>
    <p>The prompt did change. It is useful because it tells you what directory you are in.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Section 5</h2>
    <h4>What happens if you press the up key?</h4>
    <p>Brings up the last commands.</p>     
    <h4>What happens if you press the down key</h4>
    <p>Brings up the most recent commands.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Section 6</h2>
    <h4>Was "Hello World" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened in the text?</h4>
    <p>"Hello World" was not printed because File.txt was not assigned by any text.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Section 7</h2>
    <h4>How does the ls commands differ from the tree command?</h4>
    <p>The ls only shows a list of directories or other stuff in the current directory while a tree will show everything connecting to the current directory.</p>
<br>
    <h4>How do you choose one over the other?</h4>
    <p>I would use the command ls because it will only list the direct files in the current directory rather than all archived and hidden files.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Section 8</h2>
    <h4>What do you think the argument sleep specifies?</h4>
    <p>The sleep command prevents the system from running while it is set in place.</p>
<br>
    <h4>Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h4>
    <p>After running the sleep command, nothing changed.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Section 9</h2>
    <h4>How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h4>
    <p>I could still run commands.</p>
<br>
    <h4>What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h4>
    <p>It means to continue working on different commands while not showing on the screen.</p>
<br>
    <h4>What do you think the numbers displayed in brackets specifies?</h4>
    <p>How many seconds have pasted since the commands started.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Section 10</h2>
    <h4>What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h4>
    <p>It gives you a list of jobs that are finished or currently running.</p>
<br>
    <h4>How do you explain your observations</h4>
    <p>The number on the left showed the order the commands were ran.</p>
<br>
<br>
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned about the basics of Tabby.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I messed up a command or list of commands.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved if I had more time because I would be able to think without being rushed.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that one letter in code can mess up everything, teaching me to be more thorough when putting in my code.</p>
